## What is Flyboy?

Flyboy is a metroidvania game based on platforming and combat mechanics. We hope to create a beautiful game with hand drawn scenarios and characters with clumsy energetic jazz music. Based on the real-world hazards for flies, weâ€™ll create bosses that will provide the players with relatable situations which can range from funny to ludicrous. Every boss will have different way of defeating it and, with unlockable, customizable abilities and weapons, players will follow the story of a young little boy who dreamt of becoming a superhero.
